Process of back propagation

Activation func - Increase the dimensionality of data


trying to find the optimal values of w1,w2 and b because there are responsible for error

y_pred = x1*w1 + x2*w2 + b

error (E) = (y_pred - y)**2

w1 = w1 - dE/dw1

w2 = w2 - dE/dw2

b = b - dE/db

this process Feed forward of neural network and back propagation repeats until the error is saturated
