            "One morning when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams he foundhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin  He lay onhis armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he couldsee his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiffsections  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed readyto slide off any moment  His many legs pitifully thin comparedwith the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as helookedWhats happened to me he thought  It wasnt a dream  His rooma proper human room although a little too small lay peacefullybetween its four familiar walls  A collection of textile sampleslay spread out on the table  Samsa was a travelling salesman  andabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of anillustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame  It showeda lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat uprightraising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower armtowards the viewerGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weatherDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feelquite sad  How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget allthis nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable todo because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his presentstate couldnt get into that position  However hard he threwhimself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was  Hemust have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that hewouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped whenhe began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never feltbeforeOh God he thought what a strenuous career it is that Ivechosen Travelling day in and day out  Doing business like thistakes much more effort than doing your own business at home and ontop of that theres the curse of travelling worries about makingtrain connections bad and irregular food contact with differentpeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone orbecome friendly with them  It can all go to Hell  He felt aslight itch up on his belly pushed himself slowly up on his backtowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better foundwhere the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of littlewhite spots which he didnt know what to make of and when he triedto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly backbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudderHe slid back into his former position  Getting up early all thetime he thought it makes you stupid  Youve got to get enoughsleep  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury  Forinstance whenever I go back to the guest house during the morningto copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sittingthere eating their breakfasts  I ought to just try that with myboss Id get kicked out on the spot  But who knows maybe thatwould be the best thing for me  If I didnt have my parents tothink about Id have given in my notice a long time ago Id havegone up to the boss and told him just what I think tell himeverything I would let him know just what I feel  Hed fall rightoff his desk And its a funny sort of business to be sitting upthere at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up thereespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss ishard of hearing  Well theres still some hope once Ive got themoney together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five orsix years I suppose  thats definitely what Ill do  Thats whenIll make the big change  First of all though Ive got to get upmy train leaves at fiveAnd he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest ofdrawers  God in Heaven he thought  It was half past six and thehands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than halfpast more like quarter to seven  Had the alarm clock not rung Hecould see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as itshould have been it certainly must have rung  Yes but was itpossible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noiseTrue he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeplybecause of that  What should he do now The next train went atseven if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad andthe collection of samples was still not packed and he did not atall feel particularly fresh and lively  And even if he did catchthe train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the officeassistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go hewould have put in his report about Gregors not being there a longtime ago  The office assistant was the bosss man spineless andwith no understanding  What about if he reported sick But thatwould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years ofservice Gregor had never once yet been ill  His boss wouldcertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurancecompany accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept thedoctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believedthat noone was ever ill but that many were workshy  And whatsmore would he have been entirely wrong in this case Gregor did infact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so longfeel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usualHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through unable to decideto get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to sevenThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head  Gregorsomebody called  it was his mother  its quarter to sevenDidnt you want to go somewhere  That gentle voice Gregor wasshocked when he heard his own voice answering it could hardly berecognised as the voice he had had before  As if from deep insidehim there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in withit the words could be made out at first but then there was a sortof echo which made them unclear leaving the hearer unsure whetherhe had heard properly or not  Gregor had wanted to give a fullanswer and explain everything but in the circumstances contentedhimself with saying Yes mother yes thankyou Im getting upnow  The change in Gregors voice probably could not be noticedoutside through the wooden door as his mother was satisfied withthis explanation and shuffled away  But this short conversationmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor againsttheir expectations was still at home and soon his father cameknocking at one of the side doors gently but with his fistGregor Gregor he called whats wrong  And after a shortwhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice GregorGregor  At the other side door his sister came plaintivelyGregor Arent you well Do you need anything  Gregor answered toboth sides Im ready now making an effort to remove all thestrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and puttinglong pauses between each individual word  His father went back tohis breakfast but his sister whispered Gregor open the door Ibeg of you  Gregor however had no thought of opening the doorand instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit acquiredfrom his travelling of locking all doors at night even when he wasat homeThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without beingdisturbed to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfastOnly then would he consider what to do next as he was well awarethat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions bylying in bed  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain inbed perhaps caused by lying awkwardly but that had always turnedout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings wouldslowly resolve themselves today  He did not have the slightestdoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the firstsign of a serious cold which was an occupational hazard fortravelling salesmenIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers he only had to blowhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves  But it becamedifficult after that especially as he was so exceptionally broadHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up butinstead of them he only had all those little legs continuouslymoving in different directions and which he was moreover unable tocontrol  If he wanted to bend one of them then that was the firstone that would stretch itself out and if he finally managed to dowhat he wanted with that leg all the others seemed to be set freeand would move about painfully  This is something that cant bedone in bed Gregor said to himself so dont keep trying to doitThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his bodyout of the bed but he had never seen this lower part and could notimagine what it looked like it turned out to be too hard to moveit went so slowly and finally almost in a frenzy when hecarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he couldgather he chose the wrong direction hit hard against the lowerbedpost and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lowerpart of his body might well at present be the most sensitiveSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bedfirst carefully turning his head to the side  This he managedquite easily and despite its breadth and its weight the bulk ofhis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the headBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into thefresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would bea miracle if his head were not injured so he became afraid to carryon pushing himself forward the same way  And he could not knockhimself out now at any price better to stay in bed than loseconsciousnessIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had beenearlier but when he lay there sighing and was once more watchinghis legs as they struggled against each other even harder thanbefore if that was possible he could think of no way of bringingpeace and order to this chaos  He told himself once more that itwas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensiblething to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could atwhatever sacrifice  At the same time though he did not forget toremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushingto desperate conclusions  At times like this he would direct hiseyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could butunfortunately even the other side of the narrow street wasenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheerto offer him  Seven oclock already he said to himself when theclock struck again seven oclock and theres still a fog likethis  And he lay there quietly a while longer breathing lightlyas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things backto their real and natural stateBut then he said to himself Before it strikes quarter past sevenIll definitely have to have got properly out of bed  And by thensomebody will have come round from work to ask whats happened to meas well as they open up at work before seven oclock  And so heset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his bodyout of the bed all at the same time  If he succeeded in falling outof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he couldprobably avoid injuring it  His back seemed to be quite hard andprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet  Hismain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make and whicheven through all the doors would probably raise concern if notalarm  But it was something that had to be riskedWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed  the newmethod was more of a game than an effort all he had to do was rockback and forth  it occurred to him how simple everything would beif somebody came to help him  Two strong people  he had his fatherand the maid in mind  would have been more than enough they wouldonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back peel himaway from the bed bend down with the load and then be patient andcareful as he swang over onto the floor where hopefully thelittle legs would find a use  Should he really call for helpthough even apart from the fact that all the doors were lockedDespite all the difficulty he was in he could not suppress a smileat this thoughtAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would havebeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard  Thetime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a finaldecision very soon  Then there was a ring at the door of the flatThatll be someone from work he said to himself and froze verystill although his little legs only became all the more lively asthey danced around  For a moment everything remained quietTheyre not opening the door Gregor said to himself caught insome nonsensical hope  But then of course the maids firm stepswent to the door as ever and opened it  Gregor only needed to hearthe visitors first words of greeting and he knew who it was  thechief clerk himself  Why did Gregor have to be the only onecondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highlysuspicious at the slightest shortcoming Were all employees everyone of them louts was there not one of them who was faithful anddevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that hecouldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a couple ofhours in the morning on company business Was it really not enoughto let one of the trainees make enquiries  assuming enquiries wereeven necessary  did the chief clerk have to come himself and didthey have to show the whole innocent family that this was sosuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have thewisdom to investigate it And more because these thoughts had madehim upset than through any proper decision he swang himself withall his force out of the bed  There was a loud thump but it wasntreally a loud noise  His fall was softened a little by the carpetand Gregors back was also more elastic than he had thought whichmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable  He had not held hishead carefully enough though and hit it as he fell annoyed and inpain he turned it and rubbed it against the carpetSomethings fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the roomon the left  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sortthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerktoo you had to concede that it was possible  But as if in gruffreply to this question the chief clerks firm footsteps in hishighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining roomFrom the room on his right Gregors sister whispered to him to lethim know Gregor the chief clerk is here  Yes I know saidGregor to himself but without daring to raise his voice loud enoughfor his sister to hear himGregor said his father now from the room to his left the chiefclerk has come round and wants to know why you didnt leave on theearly train  We dont know what to say to him  And anyway hewants to speak to you personally  So please open up this door  Imsure hell be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your roomThen the chief clerk called Good morning  Mr Samsa He isntwell said his mother to the chief clerk while his fathercontinued to speak through the door  He isnt well please believeme  Why else would Gregor have missed a train The lad only everthinks about the business  It nearly makes me cross the way henever goes out in the evenings hes been in town for a week now butstayed home every evening  He sits with us in the kitchen and justreads the paper or studies train timetables  His idea of relaxationis working with his fretsaw  Hes made a little frame forinstance it only took him two or three evenings youll be amazedhow nice it is its hanging up in his room youll see it as soonas Gregor opens the door  Anyway Im glad youre here we wouldnthave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves hes sostubborn and Im sure he isnt well he said this morning that heis but he isnt  Ill be there in a moment said Gregor slowlyand thoughtfully but without moving so that he would not miss anyword of the conversation  Well I cant think of any other way ofexplaining it  Mrs Samsa said the chief clerk I hope itsnothing serious  But on the other hand I must say that if wepeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then fortunately orunfortunately as you like we simply have to overcome it because ofbusiness considerations  Can the chief clerk come in to see younow then asked his father impatiently knocking at the dooragain  No said Gregor  In the room on his right there followeda painful silence in the room on his left his sister began to crySo why did his sister not go and join the others She had probablyonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed  And why wasshe crying Was it because he had not got up and had not let thechief clerk in because he was in danger of losing his job and ifthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with thesame demands as before There was no need to worry about things likethat yet  Gregor was still there and had not the slightestintention of abandoning his family  For the time being he just laythere on the carpet and noone who knew the condition he was inwould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in  It wasonly a minor discourtesy and a suitable excuse could easily befound for it later on it was not something for which Gregor couldbe sacked on the spot  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensibleto leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking athim and crying  But the others didnt know what was happening theywere worried that would excuse their behaviourThe chief clerk now raised his voice Mr Samsa he called to himwhat is wrong You barricade yourself in your room give us no morethan yes or no for an answer you are causing serious andunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail  and I mentionthis just by the way  you fail to carry out your business duties ina way that is quite unheard of  Im speaking here on behalf of yourparents and of your employer and really must request a clear andimmediate explanation  I am astonished quite astonished  Ithought I knew you as a calm and sensible person and now yousuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims  This morningyour employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure toappear its true  it had to do with the money that was recentlyentrusted to you  but I came near to giving him my word of honourthat that could not be the right explanation  But now that I seeyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wishwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf  And nor is your positionall that secure  I had originally intended to say all this to youin private but since you cause me to waste my time here for no goodreason I dont see why your parents should not also learn of itYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late I grant you thatits not the time of year to do especially good business werecognise that but there simply is no time of year to do nobusiness at all  Mr Samsa we cannot allow there to beBut Sir called Gregor beside himself and forgetting all else inthe excitement Ill open up immediately just a moment  Imslightly unwell an attack of dizziness I havent been able to getup  Im still in bed now  Im quite fresh again now though  Imjust getting out of bed  Just a moment  Be patient Its not quiteas easy as Id thought  Im quite alright now though  Itsshocking what can suddenly happen to a person I was quite alrightlast night my parents know about it perhaps better than me I hada small symptom of it last night already  They must have noticedit  I dont know why I didnt let you know at work But you alwaysthink you can get over an illness without staying at home  Pleasedont make my parents suffer Theres no basis for any of theaccusations youre making nobodys ever said a word to me about anyof these things  Maybe you havent read the latest contracts I sentin  Ill set off with the eight oclock train as well these fewhours of rest have given me strength  You dont need to wait sirIll be in the office soon after you and please be so good as totell that to the boss and recommend me to himAnd while Gregor gushed out these words hardly knowing what he wassaying he made his way over to the chest of drawers  this waseasily done probably because of the practise he had already had inbed  where he now tried to get himself upright  He really did wantto open the door really did want to let them see him and to speakwith the chief clerk the others were being so insistent and he wascurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of himIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregorsresponsibility and he could rest  If however they took everythingcalmly he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurriedhe really could be at the station for eight oclock  The first fewtimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he justslid down again but he finally gave himself one last swing andstood there upright the lower part of his body was in serious painbut he no longer gave any attention to it  Now he let himself fallagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges ofit with his little legs  By now he had also calmed down and keptquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was sayingDid you understand a word of all that the chief clerk asked hisparents surely hes not trying to make fools of us Oh Godcalled his mother who was already in tears he could be seriouslyill and were making him suffer  Grete Grete she then criedMother his sister called from the other side  They communicatedacross Gregors room  Youll have to go for the doctor straightaway  Gregor is ill  Quick get the doctor  Did you hear the wayGregor spoke just now  That was the voice of an animal said thechief clerk with a calmness that was in contrast with his mothersscreams  Anna Anna his father called into the kitchen throughthe entrance hall clapping his hands get a locksmith here nowAnd the two girls their skirts swishing immediately ran outthrough the hall wrenching open the front door of the flat as theywent  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly Therewas no sound of the door banging shut again they must have left itopen  people often do in homes where something awful has happenedGregor in contrast had become much calmer  So they couldntunderstand his words any more although they seemed clear enough tohim clearer than before  perhaps his ears had become used to thesound  They had realised though that there was something wrongwith him and were ready to help  The first response to hissituation had been confident and wise and that made him feelbetter  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people andfrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprisingachievements  although he did not really distinguish one from theother  Whatever was said next would be crucial so in order tomake his voice as clear as possible he coughed a little but takingcare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sounddifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer surehe could judge this for himself  Meanwhile it had become veryquiet in the next room  Perhaps his parents were sat at the tablewhispering with the chief clerk or perhaps they were all pressedagainst the door and listeningGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair  Oncethere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door holdinghimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of hislegs  He rested there a little while to recover from the effortinvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in thelock with his mouth  He seemed unfortunately to have no properteeth  how was he then to grasp the key  but the lack of teethwas of course made up for with a very strong jaw using the jawhe really was able to start the key turning ignoring the fact thathe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid camefrom his mouth flowed over the key and dripped onto the floorListen said the chief clerk in the next room hes turning thekey  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this but they all shouldhave been calling to him his father and his mother too Well doneGregor they should have cried keep at it keep hold of thelock  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following hisefforts he bit on the key with all his strength paying noattention to the pain he was causing himself  As the key turnedround he turned around the lock with it only holding himselfupright with his mouth and hung onto the key or pushed it downagain with the whole weight of his body as needed  The clear soundof the lock as it snapped back was Gregors sign that he could breakhis concentration and as he regained his breath he said to himselfSo I didnt need the locksmith after all Then he lay his head onthe handle of the door to open it completelyBecause he had to open the door in this way it was already wideopen before he could be seen  He had first to slowly turn himselfaround one of the double doors and he had to do it very carefullyif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering theroom  He was still occupied with this difficult movement unable topay attention to anything else when he heard the chief clerkexclaim a loud Oh which sounded like the soughing of the windNow he also saw him  he was the nearest to the door  his handpressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven bya steady and invisible force  Gregors mother her hair stilldishevelled from bed despite the chief clerks being there lookedat his father  Then she unfolded her arms took two steps forwardtowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts thatspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down ontoher breast  His father looked hostile and clenched his fists as ifwanting to knock Gregor back into his room  Then he lookeduncertainly round the living room covered his eyes with his handsand wept so that his powerful chest shookSo Gregor did not go into the room but leant against the inside ofthe other door which was still held bolted in place  In this wayonly half of his body could be seen along with his head above itwhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the othersMeanwhile the day had become much lighter part of the endlessgreyblack building on the other side of the street  which was ahospital  could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regularline of windows piercing its facade the rain was stillfalling now throwing down large individual droplets which hit theground one at a time  The washing up from breakfast lay on thetable there was so much of it because for Gregors fatherbreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he wouldstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number ofdifferent newspapers  On the wall exactly opposite there wasphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army his swordin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forthrespect for his uniform and bearing  The door to the entrance hallwas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he couldsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way downbelowNow then said Gregor well aware that he was the only one tohave kept calm Ill get dressed straight away now pack up mysamples and set off  Will you please just let me leave You cansee he said to the chief clerk that Im not stubborn and Ilike to do my job being a commercial traveller is arduous butwithout travelling I couldnt earn my living  So where are yougoing in to the office Yes Will you report everything accuratelythen Its quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable towork but thats just the right time to remember whats beenachieved in the past and consider that later on once the difficultyhas been removed he will certainly work with all the more diligenceand concentration  Youre well aware that Im seriously in debt toour employer as well as having to look after my parents and mysister so that Im trapped in a difficult situation but I willwork my way out of it again  Please dont make things any harderfor me than they are already and dont take sides against me at theoffice  I know that nobody likes the travellers  They think weearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it  Thatsjust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better ofit  But you sir you have a better overview than the rest of thestaff in fact if I can say this in confidence a better overviewthan the boss himself  its very easy for a businessman like him tomake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly thanhe should  And youre also well aware that we travellers spendalmost the whole year away from the office so that we can veryeasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaintsand its almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort ofthing we dont usually even hear about them or if at all its whenwe arrive back home exhausted from a trip and thats when we feelthe harmful effects of whats been going on without even knowingwhat caused them  Please dont go away at least first saysomething to show that you grant that Im at least partly rightBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started tospeak and with protruding lips only stared back at him over histrembling shoulders as he left  He did not keep still for a momentwhile Gregor was speaking but moved steadily towards the doorwithout taking his eyes off him  He moved very gradually as ifthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room  It wasonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a suddenmovement drew his foot from the living room and rushed forward ina panic  In the hall he stretched his right hand far out towardsthe stairway as if out there there were some supernatural forcewaiting to save himGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chiefclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to beput into extreme danger  That was something his parents did notunderstand very well over the years they had become convinced thatthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life and besidesthey had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sightof any thought for the future  Gregor though did think about thefuture  The chief clerk had to be held back calmed down convincedand finally won over the future of Gregor and his family dependedon it If only his sister were here She was clever she was alreadyin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back  Andthe chief clerk was a lover of women surely she could persuade himshe would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him outof his shocked state  But his sister was not there Gregor wouldhave to do the job himself  And without considering that he stillwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his presentstate or that his speech still might not  or probably would not be understood he let go of the door pushed himself through theopening tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing whoridiculously was holding on to the banister with both hands butGregor fell immediately over and with a little scream as he soughtsomething to hold onto landed on his numerous little legs  Hardlyhad that happened than for the first time that day he began tofeel alright with his body the little legs had the solid groundunder them to his pleasure they did exactly as he told them theywere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go andhe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally atan end  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to sideas he crouched there on the floor  His mother was not far away infront of him and seemed at first quite engrossed in herself butthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and herfingers spread shouting Help for pitys sake Help  The way sheheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better but theunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did notshe had forgotten that the table was behind her with all thebreakfast things on it when she reached the table she sat quicklydown on it without knowing what she was doing without even seemingto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush ofcoffee was pouring down onto the carpetMother mother said Gregor gently looking up at her  He hadcompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could nothelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of theflow of coffee  That set his mother screaming anew she fled fromthe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards herGregor though had no time to spare for his parents now the chiefclerk had already reached the stairs with his chin on the banisterhe looked back for the last time  Gregor made a run for him hewanted to be sure of reaching him the chief clerk must haveexpected something as he leapt down several steps at once anddisappeared his shouts resounding all around the staircase  Theflight of the chief clerk seemed unfortunately to put Gregorsfather into a panic as well  Until then he had been relatively selfcontrolled but now instead of running after the chief clerkhimself or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after himGregors father seized the chief clerks stick in his right handthe chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hatand overcoat picked up a large newspaper from the table with hisleft and used them to drive Gregor back into his room stamping hisfoot at him as he went  Gregors appeals to his father were of nohelp his appeals were simply not understood however much he humblyturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harderAcross the room despite the chilly weather Gregors mother hadpulled open a window leant far out of it and pressed her hands toher face  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towardsthe stairway the curtains flew up the newspapers on the tablefluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor  Nothing wouldstop Gregors father as he drove him back making hissing noises athim like a wild man  Gregor had never had any practice in movingbackwards and was only able to go very slowly  If Gregor had onlybeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his roomstraight away but he was afraid that if he took the time to do thathis father would become impatient and there was the threat of alethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his fathers handany moment  Eventually though Gregor realised that he had nochoice as he saw to his disgust that he was quite incapable ofgoing backwards in a straight line so he began as quickly aspossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father to turnhimself round  It went very slowly but perhaps his father was ableto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him in factnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from adistance as to which way to turn  If only his father would stopthat unbearable hissing It was making Gregor quite confused  Whenhe had nearly finished turning round still listening to thathissing he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the wayhe had just come  He was pleased when he finally had his head infront of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and hisbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty  Inhis present mood it obviously did not occur to his father to openthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough spaceto get through  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor shouldbe got back into his room as quickly as possible  Nor would he everhave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparationfor getting through the doorway  What he did making more noisethan ever was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if therehad been nothing in the way it sounded to Gregor as if there wasnow more than one father behind him it was not a pleasantexperience and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway withoutregard for what might happen  One side of his body lifted itselfhe lay at an angle in the doorway one flank scraped on the whitedoor and was painfully injured leaving vile brown flecks on itsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at allby himself the little legs along one side hung quivering in the airwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against theground  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind whichreleased him from where he was held and sent him flying and heavilybleeding deep into his room  The door was slammed shut with thestick then finally all was quietIIIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awokefrom his deep and comalike sleep  He would have woken soonafterwards anyway even if he hadnt been disturbed as he had hadenough sleep and felt fully rested  But he had the impression thatsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the frontroom being carefully shut had woken him  The light from theelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceilingand tops of the furniture but down below where Gregor was it wasdark  He pushed himself over to the door feeling his way clumsilywith his antennae  of which he was now beginning to learn the value in order to see what had been happening there  The whole of hisleft side seemed like one painfully stretched scar  and he limpedbadly on his two rows of legs  One of the legs had been badlyinjured in the events of that morning  it was nearly a miracle thatonly one of them had been  and dragged along lifelesslyIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what itactually was that had drawn him over to it it was the smell ofsomething to eat  By the door there was a dish filled withsweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it  Hewas so pleased he almost laughed as he was even hungrier than hehad been that morning and immediately dipped his head into themilk nearly covering his eyes with it  But he soon drew his headback again in disappointment not only did the pain in his tenderleft side make it difficult to eat the food  he was only able toeat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole  but themilk did not taste at all nice  Milk like this was normally hisfavourite drink and his sister had certainly left it there for himbecause of that but he turned almost against his own will awayfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the roomThrough the crack in the door Gregor could see that the gas hadbeen lit in the living room  His father at this time would normallybe sat with his evening paper reading it out in a loud voice toGregors mother and sometimes to his sister but there was now nota sound to be heard  Gregors sister would often write and tell himabout this reading but maybe his father had lost the habit inrecent times  It was so quiet all around too even though theremust have been somebody in the flat  What a quiet life it is thefamily lead said Gregor to himself and gazing into the darknessfelt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that insuch a nice home for his sister and parents  But what now if allthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible andfrightening end That was something that Gregor did not want tothink about too much so he started to move about crawling up anddown the roomOnce during that long evening the door on one side of the room wasopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again later on the dooron the other side did the same it seemed that someone needed toenter the room but thought better of it  Gregor went and waitedimmediately by the door resolved either to bring the timorousvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who itwas but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited invain  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone hadwanted to get in there to him but now now that he had opened upone of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some timeduring the day noone came and the keys were in the other sidesIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living roomwas put out and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister hadstayed awake all that time as they all could be distinctly heard asthey went away together on tiptoe  It was clear that noone wouldcome into Gregors room any more until morning that gave him plentyof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to rearrangehis life  For some reason the tall empty room where he was forcedto remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the flooreven though he had been living in it for five years  Hardly awareof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame hehurried under the couch  It pressed down on his back a little andhe was no longer able to lift his head but he nonetheless feltimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was toobroad to get it all underneathHe spent the whole night there  Some of the time he passed in alight sleep although he frequently woke from it in alarm because ofhis hunger and some of the time was spent in worries and vaguehopes which however always led to the same conclusion for thetime being he must remain calm he must show patience and thegreatest consideration so that his family could bear theunpleasantness that he in his present condition was forced toimpose on themGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of hisdecisions as early the next morning almost before the night hadended his sister nearly fully dressed opened the door from thefront room and looked anxiously in  She did not see him straightaway but when she did notice him under the couch  he had to besomewhere for Gods sake he couldnt have flown away  she was soshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shutagain from outside  But she seemed to regret her behaviour as sheopened the door again straight away and came in on tiptoe as ifentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a strangerGregor had pushed his head forward right to the edge of the couchand watched her  Would she notice that he had left the milk as itwas realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring himin some other food that was more suitable If she didnt do itherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to italthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under thecouch throw himself at his sisters feet and beg her for somethinggood to eat  However his sister noticed the full dish immediatelyand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it withsome surprise  She immediately picked it up  using a ragnot her bare hands  and carried it out  Gregor was extremelycurious as to what she would bring in its place imagining thewildest possibilities but he never could have guessed what hissister in her goodness actually did bring  In order to test histaste she brought him a whole selection of things all spread outon an old newspaper  There were old halfrotten vegetables bonesfrom the evening meal covered in white sauce that had gone hard afew raisins and almonds some cheese that Gregor had declaredinedible two days before a dry roll and some bread spread withbutter and salt  As well as all that she had poured some water intothe dish which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregorsuse and placed it beside them  Then out of consideration forGregors feelings as she knew that he would not eat in front ofher she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock sothat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable forhimself as he liked  Gregors little legs whirred at last he couldeat  Whats more his injuries must already have completely healedas he found no difficulty in moving  This amazed him as more thana month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife hethought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterdayAm I less sensitive than I used to be then he thought and wasalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately almostcompellingly attracted him much more than the other foods on thenewspaper  Quickly one after another his eyes watering withpleasure he consumed the cheese the vegetables and the sauce thefresh foods on the other hand he didnt like at all and evendragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from thembecause he couldnt stand the smell  Long after he had finishedeating and lay lethargic in the same place his sister slowly turnedthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw  Hewas immediately startled although he had been half asleep and hehurried back under the couch  But he needed great selfcontrol tostay there even for the short time that his sister was in the roomas eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and hecould hardly breathe in that narrow space  Half suffocating hewatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took abroom and swept up the leftovers mixing them in with the food hehad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any moreShe quickly dropped it all into a bin closed it with its woodenlid and carried everything out  She had hardly turned her backbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretchedhimselfThis was how Gregor received his food each day now once in themorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep and thesecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as hisparents would sleep for a little while then as well and Gregorssister would send the maid away on some errand  Gregors father andmother certainly did not want him to starve either but perhaps itwould have been more than they could stand to have any moreexperience of his feeding than being told about it and perhaps hissister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they wereindeed suffering enoughIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told thedoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of theflat  As nobody could understand him nobody not even his sisterthought that he could understand them so he had to be content tohear his sisters sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved abouthis room  It was only later when she had become a little more usedto everything  there was of course no question of her everbecoming fully used to the situation  that Gregor would sometimescatch a friendly comment or at least a comment that could beconstrued as friendly  Hes enjoyed his dinner today she mightsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for himor if he left most of it which slowly became more and morefrequent she would often say sadly now everythings just beenleft there againAlthough Gregor wasnt able to hear any news directly he did listento much of what was said in the next rooms and whenever he heardanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door andpress his whole body against it  There was seldom any conversationespecially at first that was not about him in some way even ifonly in secret  For two whole days all the talk at every mealtimewas about what they should do now but even between meals they spokeabout the same subject as there were always at least two members ofthe family at home  nobody wanted to be at home by themselves andit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty  And onthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and beggedGregors mother to let her go without delay  It was not very clearhow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarterof an hour tearfully thanking Gregors mother for her dismissal asif she had done her an enormous service  She even sworeemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what hadhappened even though noone had asked that of herNow Gregors sister also had to help his mother with the cookingalthough that was not so much bother as noone ate very muchGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge anotherto eat and receive no more answer than no thanks Ive had enoughor something similar  Noone drank very much either  His sisterwould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer hopingfor the chance to go and fetch it herself  When his father thensaid nothing she would add so that he would not feel selfish thatshe could send the housekeeper for it but then his father wouldclose the matter with a big loud No and no more would be saidEven before the first day had come to an end his father hadexplained to Gregors mother and sister what their finances andprospects were  Now and then he stood up from the table and tooksome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved fromhis business when it had collapsed five years earlier  Gregor heardhow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after hehad taken the item he wanted  What he heard his father say was someof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first beenincarcerated in his room  He had thought that nothing at allremained from his fathers business at least he had never told himanything different and Gregor had never asked him about it anywayTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of totaldespair and Gregors only concern at that time had been to arrangethings so that they could all forget about it as quickly aspossible  So then he started working especially hard with a fieryvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travellingrepresentative almost overnight bringing with it the chance to earnmoney in quite different ways  Gregor converted his success at workstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for thebenefit of his astonished and delighted family  They had been goodtimes and they had never come again at least not with the samesplendour even though Gregor had later earned so much that he wasin a position to bear the costs of the whole family and did bearthem  They had even got used to it both Gregor and the familythey took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide italthough there was no longer much warm affection given in returnGregor only remained close to his sister now  Unlike him she wasvery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist it was hissecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though itwould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in someother way  During Gregors short periods in town conversation withhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only evermentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised  Theirparents did not like to hear this innocent talk but Gregor thoughtabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what heplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas dayThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through hismind in his present state pressed upright against the door andlistening  There were times when he simply became too tired tocontinue listening when his head would fall wearily against thedoor and he would pull it up again with a start as even theslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they wouldall go silent  Whats that hes doing now his father would sayafter a while clearly having gone over to the door and only thenwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up againWhen explaining things his father repeated himself several timespartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied withthese matters himself and partly because Gregors mother did notunderstand everything the first time  From these repeated explanationsGregor learned to his pleasure that despite all their misfortunesthere was still some money available from the old days  It was nota lot but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interesthad accumulated  Besides that they had not been using up all themoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month keeping only alittle for himself so that that too had been accumulatingBehind the door Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure atthis unexpected thrift and caution  He could actually have usedthis surplus money to reduce his fathers debt to his boss and theday when he could have freed himself from that job would have comemuch closer but now it was certainly better the way his father haddone thingsThis money however was certainly not enough to enable the familyto live off the interest it was enough to maintain them forperhaps one or two years no more  Thats to say it was moneythat should not really be touched but set aside for emergenciesmoney to live on had to be earned  His father was healthy but oldand lacking in self confidence  During the five years that he hadnot been working  the first holiday in a life that had been full ofstrain and no success  he had put on a lot of weight and becomevery slow and clumsy  Would Gregors elderly mother now have to goand earn money She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for herjust to move about the home every other day would be spentstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window  Would hissister have to go and earn money She was still a child ofseventeen her life up till then had been very enviable consistingof wearing nice clothes sleeping late helping out in the businessjoining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing theviolin  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn moneyGregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himselfonto the cool leather sofa next to it as he became quite hot withshame and regretHe would often lie there the whole night through not sleeping awink but scratching at the leather for hours on end  Or he might goto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window climbing up ontothe sill and propped up in the chair leaning on the window tostare out of it  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom fromdoing this but doing it now was obviously something more rememberedthan experienced  as what he actually saw in this way was becomingless distinct every day even things that were quite near he hadused to curse the everpresent view of the hospital across thestreet but now he could not see it at all and if he had not knownthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse which was a quiet street despitebeing in the middle of the city he could have thought that he waslooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and thegrey earth mingled inseparably  His observant sister only needed tonotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to itsexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room andeven left the inner pane of the window open from then onIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank herfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for himto bear it but as it was it caused him pain  His sisternaturally tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothingburdensome about it and the longer it went on of course thebetter she was able to do so but as time went by Gregor was alsoable to see through it all so much better  It had even become veryunpleasant for him now whenever she entered the room  No soonerhad she come in than she would quickly close the door as aprecaution so that noone would have to suffer the view intoGregors room then she would go straight to the window and pull ithurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating  Even if it wascold she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a littlewhile  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running aboutand noise making he would stay under the couch shivering the wholewhile knowing full well that she would certainly have liked tospare him this ordeal but it was impossible for her to be in thesame room with him with the windows closedOne day about a month after Gregors transformation when his sisterno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearanceshe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found himstill staring out the window motionless and just where he would bemost horrible  In itself his sisters not coming into the roomwould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have beendifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was stillthere but not only did she not come in she went straight back andclosed the door behind her a stranger would have thought he hadthreatened her and tried to bite her  Gregor went straight to hidehimself under the couch of course but he had to wait until middaybefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy thanusual  It made him realise that she still found his appearanceunbearable and would continue to do so she probably even had toovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him thatprotruded from under the couch  One day in order to spare her eventhis sight he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to thecouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely coveredand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent downIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to dowas take it off again as it was clear enough that it was nopleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely  She left thesheet where it was  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look ofgratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheetto see how his sister liked the new arrangementFor the first fourteen days Gregors parents could not bringthemselves to come into the room to see him  He would often hearthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doingeven though before they had seen her as a girl who was somewhatuseless and frequently been annoyed with her  But now the two ofthem father and mother would often both wait outside the door ofGregors room while his sister tidied up in there and as soon asshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly howeverything looked what Gregor had eaten how he had behaved thistime and whether perhaps any slight improvement could be seenHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon buthis father and sister at first persuaded her against it  Gregorlistened very closely to all this and approved fully  Laterthough she had to be held back by force which made her call outLet me go and see Gregor he is my unfortunate son Cant youunderstand I have to see him and Gregor would think to himselfthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in not every dayof course but one day a week perhaps she could understandeverything much better than his sister who for all her courage wasstill just a child after all and really might not have had anadults appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken onGregors wish to see his mother was soon realised  Out ofconsideration for his parents Gregor wanted to avoid being seen atthe window during the day the few square meters of the floor didnot give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just liequietly through the night his food soon stopped giving him anypleasure at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habitof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling  He was especiallyfond of hanging from the ceiling it was quite different from lyingon the floor he could breathe more freely his body had a lightswing to it and up there relaxed and almost happy it might happenthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling andlanding on the floor with a crash  But now of course he had farbetter control of his body than before and even with a fall asgreat as that caused himself no damage  Very soon his sisternoticed Gregors new way of entertaining himself  he had afterall left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him byremoving the furniture that got in his way especially the chest ofdrawers and the desk  Now this was not something that she would beable to do by herself she did not dare to ask for help from herfather the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since thecook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this shehad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all timesand never to have to open the door unless it was especiallyimportant so his sister had no choice but to choose some time whenGregors father was not there and fetch his mother to help her  Asshe approached the room Gregor could hear his mother express herjoy but once at the door she went silent  First of course hissister came in and looked round to see that everything in the roomwas alright and only then did she let her mother enter  Gregor hadhurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put morefolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had justbeen thrown down by chance  Gregor also refrained this time fromspying out from under the sheet he gave up the chance to see hismother until later and was simply glad that she had come  You cancome in he cant be seen said his sister obviously leading herin by the hand  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pairof feeble women to be heaving about but Gregor listened as theypushed it from its place his sister always taking on the heaviestpart of the work for herself and ignoring her mothers warnings thatshe would strain herself  This lasted a very long time  Afterlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it wouldbe better to leave the chest where it was for one thing it was tooheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregors father gothome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his wayeven more and for another thing it wasnt even sure that taking thefurniture away would really be any help to him  She thought justthe opposite the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to herheart and why wouldnt Gregor feel the same way about it hed beenused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would makehim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that  Then quietlyalmost whispering as if wanting Gregor whose whereabouts she didnot know to hear not even the tone of her voice as she wasconvinced that he did not understand her words she added and bytaking the furniture away wont it seem like were showing thatweve given up all hope of improvement and were abandoning him tocope for himself I think itd be best to leave the room exactly theway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again hellfind everything unchanged and hell be able to forget the time inbetween all the easierHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that thelack of any direct human communication along with the monotonouslife led by the family during these two months must have made himconfused  he could think of no other way of explaining to himselfwhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out  Had he reallywanted to transform his room into a cave a warm room fitted outwith the nice furniture he had inherited That would have let himcrawl around unimpeded in any direction but it would also have lethim quickly forget his past when he had still been human  He hadcome very close to forgetting and it had only been the voice of hismother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it  Nothingshould be removed everything had to stay he could not do withoutthe good influence the furniture had on his condition and if thefurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly thatwas not a loss but a great advantageHis sister unfortunately did not agree she had become used to theidea not without reason that she was Gregors spokesman to hisparents about the things that concerned him  This meant that hismothers advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist onremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk as she hadthought at first but all the furniture apart from the allimportantcouch  It was more than childish perversity of course or theunexpected confidence she had recently acquired that made herinsist she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room tocrawl about in whereas the furniture as far as anyone could seewas of no use to him at all  Girls of that age though do becomeenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way wheneverthey can  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregorssituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could doeven more for him  Grete would probably be the only one who woulddare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare wallsby himselfSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her  Gregors motheralready looked uneasy in his room she soon stopped speaking andhelped Gregors sister to get the chest of drawers out with whatstrength she had  The chest of drawers was something that Gregorcould do without if he had to but the writing desk had to stayHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers groaning outof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch tosee what he could do about it  He meant to be as careful andconsiderate as he could but unfortunately it was his mother whocame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round thechest pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herselfwithout of course moving it an inch  His mother was not used tothe sight of Gregor he might have made her ill so Gregor hurriedbackwards to the far end of the couch  In his startlement thoughhe was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving alittle  It was enough to attract his mothers attention  She stoodvery still remained there a moment and then went back out toGreteGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual washappening it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved afterall but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro theirlittle calls to each other the scraping of the furniture on thefloor all these things made him feel as if he were being assailedfrom all sides  With his head and legs pulled in against him andhis body pressed to the floor he was forced to admit to himselfthat he could not stand all of this much longer  They were emptyinghis room out taking away everything that was dear to him they hadalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other toolsnow they threatened to remove the writing desk with its placeclearly worn into the floor the desk where he had done his homeworkas a business trainee at high school even while he had been atinfant schoolhe really could not wait any longer to see whetherthe two womens intentions were good  He had nearly forgotten theywere there anyway as they were now too tired to say anything whilethey worked and he could only hear their feet as they steppedheavily on the floorSo while the women were leant against the desk in the other roomcatching their breath he sallied out changed direction four timesnot knowing what he should save first before his attention wassuddenly caught by the picture on the wall  which was alreadydenuded of everything else that had been on it  of the lady dressedin copious fur  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himselfagainst its glass it held him firmly and felt good on his hotbelly  This picture at least now totally covered by Gregor wouldcertainly be taken away by noone  He turned his head to face thedoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when theycame backThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quitesoon Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearlycarrying her  What shall we take now then said Grete andlooked around  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall  Perhapsonly because her mother was there she remained calm bent her faceto her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurriedlyand with a tremor in her voice Come on lets go back in theliving room for a while  Gregor could see what Grete had in mindshe wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him downfrom the wall  Well she could certainly try it He sat unyieldingon his picture  He would rather jump at Gretes faceBut Gretes words had made her mother quite worried she stepped toone side saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of thewallpaper and before she even realised it was Gregor that she sawscreamed Oh God oh God  Arms outstretched she fell onto thecouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobileGregor shouted his sister glowering at him and shaking her fist That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since histransformation  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind ofsmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint Gregor wantedto help too  he could save his picture later although he stuckfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force then hetoo ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like inthe old days but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing shewas looking into various bottles he startled her when she turnedround a bottle fell to the ground and broke a splinter cutGregors face some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over himnow without delaying any longer Grete took hold of all the bottlesshe could and ran with them in to her mother she slammed the doorshut with her foot  So now Gregor was shut out from his motherwho because of him might be near to death he could not open thedoor if he did not want to chase his sister away and she had tostay with his mother there was nothing for him to do but wait andoppressed with anxiety and selfreproach he began to crawl abouthe crawled over everything walls furniture ceiling and finallyin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he felldown into the middle of the dinner tableHe lay there for a while numb and immobile all around him it wasquiet maybe that was a good sign  Then there was someone at thedoor  The maid of course had locked herself in her kitchen sothat Grete would have to go and answer it  His father had arrivedhome  Whats happened were his first words Gretes appearancemust have made everything clear to him  She answered him withsubdued voice and openly pressed her face into his chest Mothersfainted but shes better now  Gregor got out  Just as Iexpected said his father just as I always said but you womenwouldnt listen would you  It was clear to Gregor that Grete hadnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that somethingbad had happened that he was responsible for some act of violenceThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father as hedid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had beenpossible  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himselfagainst it so that his father when he came in from the hall couldsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would goback into his room without delay that it would not be necessary todrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he woulddisappearHis father though was not in the mood to notice subtleties likethat Ah he shouted as he came in sounding as if he were bothangry and glad at the same time  Gregor drew his head back from thedoor and lifted it towards his father  He really had not imaginedhis father the way he stood there now of late with his new habitof crawling about he had neglected to pay attention to what wasgoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before  He reallyought to have expected things to have changed but still still wasthat really his father The same tired man as used to be layingthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his businesstrips who would receive him sitting in the armchair in hisnightgown when he came back in the evenings who was hardly evenable to stand up but as a sign of his pleasure would just raisehis arms and who on the couple of times a year when they went for awalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly inhis overcoat between Gregor and his mother would always labour hisway forward a little more slowly than them who were already walkingslowly for his sake who would place his stick down carefully andif he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather hiscompanions around him  He was standing up straight enough nowdressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons the sort worn bythe employees at the banking institute above the high stiff collarof the coat his strong doublechin emerged under the bushyeyebrows his piercing dark eyes looked out fresh and alert hisnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to hisscalp  He took his cap with its gold monogram from probably somebank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofaput his hands in his trouser pockets pushing back the bottom of hislong uniform coat and with look of determination walked towardsGregor  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mindbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high  Gregor was amazedat the enormous size of the soles of his boots but wasted no timewith that  he knew full well right from the first day of his newlife that his father thought it necessary to always be extremelystrict with him  And so he ran up to his father stopped when hisfather stopped scurried forwards again when he moved evenslightly  In this way they went round the room several timeswithout anything decisive happening without even giving theimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly  Gregor remainedall this time on the floor largely because he feared his fathermight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall orceiling  Whatever he did Gregor had to admit that he certainlywould not be able to keep up this running about for long as foreach step his father took he had to carry out countless movementsHe became noticeably short of breath even in his earlier life hislungs had not been very reliable  Now as he lurched about in hisefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he couldhardly keep his eyes open his thoughts became too slow for him tothink of any other way of saving himself than running he almostforgot that the walls were there for him to use although here theywere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches andprotrusions  then right beside him lightly tossed something flewdown and rolled in front of him  It was an apple then another oneimmediately flew at him Gregor froze in shock there was no longerany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him  Hehad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard andnow without even taking the time for careful aim threw one appleafter another  These little red apples rolled about on the floorknocking into each other as if they had electric motors  An applethrown without much force glanced against Gregors back and slid offwithout doing any harm  Another one however immediately followingit hit squarely and lodged in his back Gregor wanted to draghimself away as if he could remove the surprising the incrediblepain by changing his position but he felt as if nailed to the spotand spread himself out all his senses in confusion  The last thinghe saw was the door of his room being pulled open his sister wasscreaming his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as hissister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted tomake it easier for her to breathe she ran to his father herskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the groundstumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father her armsaround him uniting herself with him totally  now Gregor lost hisability to see anything  her hands behind his fathers head begginghim to spare Gregors lifeIIINoone dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregors flesh so itremained there as a visible reminder of his injury  He had sufferedit there for more than a month and his condition seemed seriousenough to remind even his father that Gregor despite his currentsad and revolting form was a family member who could not be treatedas an enemy  On the contrary as a family there was a duty toswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient just to be patientBecause of his injuries Gregor had lost much of his mobility probably permanently  He had been reduced to the condition of anancient invalid and it took him long long minutes to crawl acrosshis room  crawling over the ceiling was out of the question  butthis deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion madeup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hoursbefore it was opened and then lying in the darkness of his roomwhere he could not be seen from the living room he could watch thefamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to theirconversation  with everyones permission in a way and thus quitedifferently from beforeThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times ofcourse the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing whenhe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room All of them were usually very quiet nowadays  Soon after dinnerhis father would go to sleep in his chair his mother and sisterwould urge each other to be quiet his mother bent deeply under thelamp would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop his sister whohad taken a sales job learned shorthand and French in the eveningsso that she might be able to get a better position later onSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregors motheryoure doing so much sewing again today as if he did not knowthat he had been dozing  and then he would go back to sleep againwhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grinWith a kind of stubbornness Gregors father refused to take hisuniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unused on its pegGregors father would slumber where he was fully dressed as ifalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of hissuperior even here  The uniform had not been new to start with butas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite theefforts of Gregors mother and sister to look after it  Gregorwould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains onthis coat with its gold buttons always kept polished and shinywhile the old man in it would sleep highly uncomfortable butpeacefulAs soon as it struck ten Gregors mother would speak gently to hisfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed as hecouldnt sleep properly where he was and he really had to get hissleep if he was to be up at six to get to work  But since he hadbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist onstaying longer at the table even though he regularly fell asleepand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange thechair for his bed  Then however much mother and sister wouldimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keepslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyesclosed and refusing to get up  Gregors mother would tug at hissleeve whisper endearments into his ear Gregors sister wouldleave her work to help her mother but nothing would have any effecton him  He would just sink deeper into his chair  Only when thetwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyeslook at them one after the other and say What a life This is whatpeace I get in my old age  And supported by the two women he wouldlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest loadhimself let the women take him to the door send them off and carryon by himself while Gregors mother would throw down her needle andhis sister her pen so that they could run after his father andcontinue being of help to himWho in this tired and overworked family would have had time togive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary Thehousehold budget became even smaller so now the maid was dismissedan enormous thickboned charwoman with white hair that flappedaround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviestwork everything else was looked after by Gregors mother on top ofthe large amount of sewing work she did  Gregor even learnedlistening to the evening conversation about what price they hadhoped for that several items of jewellery belonging to the familyhad been sold even though both mother and sister had been very fondof wearing them at functions and celebrations  But the loudestcomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for theirpresent circumstances they could not move out of it there was noimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address  He couldsee quite well though that there were more reasons thanconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move itwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable cratewith a few air holes in it the main thing holding the family backfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their totaldespair and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortuneunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were relatedto  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expectsfrom poor people Gregors father brought bank employees theirbreakfast his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes forstrangers his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at thebehest of the customers but they just did not have the strength todo any more  And the injury in Gregors back began to hurt as muchas when it was new  After they had come back from taking his fatherto bed Gregors mother and sister would now leave their work whereit was and sit close together cheek to cheek his mother wouldpoint to Gregors room and say Close that door Grete and thenwhen he was in the dark again they would sit in the next room andtheir tears would mingle or they would simply sit there staringdryeyed at the tableGregor hardly slept at all either night or day  Sometimes he wouldthink of taking over the familys affairs just like before thenext time the door was opened he had long forgotten about his bossand the chief clerk but they would appear again in his thoughtsthe salesmen and the apprentices that stupid teaboy two or threefriends from other businesses one of the chambermaids from aprovincial hotel a tender memory that appeared and disappearedagain a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had beenserious but too slow  all of them appeared to him mixed togetherwith strangers and others he had forgotten but instead of helpinghim and his family they were all of them inaccessible and he wasglad when they disappeared  Other times he was not at all in themood to look after his family he was filled with simple rage aboutthe lack of attention he was shown and although he could think ofnothing he would have wanted he made plans of how he could get intothe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled toeven if he was not hungry  Gregors sister no longer thought abouthow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or otherinto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in themorning and at midday and in the evening she would sweep it awayagain with the broom indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or more often than not  had been left totally untouched  She stillcleared up the room in the evening but now she could not have beenany quicker about it  Smears of dirt were left on the walls hereand there were little balls of dust and filth  At first Gregorwent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrivedas a reproach to her but he could have stayed there for weekswithout his sister doing anything about it she could see the dirtas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to itAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new forher and which everyone in the family understood  cleaning upGregors room was for her and her alone  Gregors mother did oncethoroughly clean his room and needed to use several bucketfuls ofwater to do it  although that much dampness also made Gregor illand he lay flat on the couch bitter and immobile  But his motherwas to be punished still more for what she had done as hardly hadhis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the changein Gregors room and highly aggrieved ran back into the livingroom where despite her mothers raised and imploring hands shebroke into convulsive tears  Her father of course was startledout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished andhelpless then they too became agitated Gregors father standingto the right of his mother accused her of not leaving the cleaningof Gregors room to his sister from her left Gregors sisterscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregors room againwhile his mother tried to draw his father who was beside himselfwith anger into the bedroom his sister quaking with tearsthumped on the table with her small fists and Gregor hissed inanger that noone had even thought of closing the door to save himthe sight of this and all its noiseGregors sister was exhausted from going out to work and lookingafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her buteven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her placeGregor on the other hand ought not to be neglected  Now thoughthe charwoman was here  This elderly widow with a robust bonestructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things inher long life wasnt really repelled by Gregor  Just by chance oneday rather than any real curiosity she opened the door to Gregorsroom and found herself face to face with him  He was taken totallyby surprise noone was chasing him but he began to rush to and frowhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed infront of her  From then on she never failed to open the doorslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him  Atfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that sheprobably considered friendly such as come on then you olddungbeetle or look at the old dungbeetle there  Gregor neverresponded to being spoken to in that way but just remained where hewas without moving as if the door had never even been opened  Ifonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every dayinstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she feltlike it One day early in the morning while a heavy rain struck thewindowpanes perhaps indicating that spring was coming she began tospeak to him in that way once again  Gregor was so resentful of itthat he started to move toward her he was slow and infirm but itwas like a kind of attack  Instead of being afraid the charwomanjust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood therewith her mouth open clearly intending not to close her mouth untilthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregors backArent you coming any closer then she asked when Gregor turnedround again and she calmly put the chair back in the cornerGregor had almost entirely stopped eating  Only if he happened tofind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him hemight take some of it into his mouth to play with it leave it therea few hours and then more often than not spit it out again  Atfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room thatstopped him eating but he had soon got used to the changes madethere  They had got into the habit of putting things into this roomthat they had no room for anywhere else and there were now manysuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out tothree gentlemen  These earnest gentlemen  all three of them hadfull beards as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the doorone day  were painfully insistent on things being tidy  Thismeant not only in their own room but since they had taken a room inthis establishment in the entire flat and especially in thekitchen  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerateespecially if it was dirty  They had moreover brought most of theirown furnishings and equipment with them  For this reason manythings had become superfluous which although they could not besold the family did not wish to discard  All these things foundtheir way into Gregors room  The dustbins from the kitchen foundtheir way in there too  The charwoman was always in a hurry andanything she couldnt use for the time being she would just chuck inthere  He fortunately would usually see no more than the objectand the hand that held it  The woman most likely meant to fetch thethings back out again when she had time and the opportunity or tothrow everything out in one go but what actually happened was thatthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrownunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhereelse  At first he moved it because with no other room free wherehe could crawl about he was forced to but later on he came toenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired todeath and he would remain immobile for hours afterwardsThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their eveningmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone and sothe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening  ButGregor found it easy to give up having the door open he had afterall often failed to make use of it when it was open and withoutthe family having noticed it lain in his room in its darkestcorner  One time though the charwoman left the door to the livingroom slightly open and it remained open when the gentlemen whorented the room came in in the evening and the light was put onThey sat up at the table where formerly Gregor had taken his mealswith his father and mother they unfolded the serviettes and pickedup their knives and forks  Gregors mother immediately appeared inthe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sisterwith a dish piled high with potatoes  The food was steaming andfilled the room with its smell  The gentlemen bent over the dishesset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food beforeeating it and the gentleman in the middle who seemed to count asan authority for the other two did indeed cut off a piece of meatwhile it was still in its dish clearly wishing to establish whetherit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to thekitchen  It was to his satisfaction and Gregors mother andsister who had been looking on anxiously began to breathe againand smiledThe family themselves ate in the kitchen  Nonetheless Gregorsfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchenbowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the tableThe gentlemen stood as one and mumbled something into their beards Then once they were alone they ate in near perfect silence  Itseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises ofeating their chewing teeth could still be heard as if they hadwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it wasnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothlesshowever nice they might be  Id like to eat something saidGregor anxiously but not anything like theyre eating  They dofeed themselves  And here I am dyingThroughout all this time Gregor could not remember having heard theviolin being played but this evening it began to be heard from thekitchen  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal theone in the middle had produced a newspaper given a page to each ofthe others and now they leant back in their chairs reading them andsmoking  When the violin began playing they became attentive stoodup and went on tiptoe over to the door of the hallway where theystood pressed against each other  Someone must have heard them inthe kitchen as Gregors father called out Is the playing perhapsunpleasant for the gentlemen We can stop it straight away  Onthe contrary said the middle gentleman would the young lady notlike to come in and play for us here in the room where it is afterall much more cosy and comfortable  Oh yes wed love tocalled back Gregors father as if he had been the violin playerhimself  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waitedGregors father soon appeared with the music stand his mother withthe music and his sister with the violin  She calmly preparedeverything for her to begin playing his parents who had neverrented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggeratedcourtesy towards the three gentlemen did not even dare to sit ontheir own chairs his father leant against the door with his righthand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat his motherthough was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat  leavingthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it  out ofthe way in a cornerHis sister began to play father and mother paid close attentionone on each side to the movements of her hands  Drawn in by theplaying Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already hadhis head in the living room  Before he had taken great pride inhow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he hadbecome so thoughtless about the others  Whats more there was nowall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in thedust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightestmovement he carried threads hairs and remains of food about onhis back and sides he was much too indifferent to everything now tolay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used todo several times a day  And despite this condition he was not tooshy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the livingroomNoone noticed him though  The family was totally preoccupied withthe violin playing at first the three gentlemen had put theirhands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the musicstand to look at all the notes being played and they must havedisturbed Gregors sister but soon in contrast with the familythey  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talkingto each other at half volume and they stayed by the window whileGregors father observed them anxiously  It really now seemed veryobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful orentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed that they hadhad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out ofpoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed  It wasespecially unnerving the way they all blew the smoke from theircigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses  Yet Gregors sisterwas playing so beautifully  Her face was leant to one sidefollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholyexpression  Gregor crawled a little further forward keeping hishead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if thechance came  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so Itseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknownnourishment he had been yearning for  He was determined to make hisway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she mightcome into his room with her violin as noone appreciated herplaying here as much as he would  He never wanted to let her out ofhis room not while he lived anyway his shocking appearanceshould for once be of some use to him he wanted to be at everydoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers hissister should not be forced to stay with him though but stay ofher own free will she would sit beside him on the couch with herear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended tosend her to the conservatory how he would have told everyone aboutit last Christmas  had Christmas really come and gone already  ifthis misfortune hadnt got in the way and refuse to let anyonedissuade him from it  On hearing all this his sister would breakout in tears of emotion and Gregor would climb up to her shoulderand kiss her neck which since she had been going out to work shehad kept free without any necklace or collarMr Samsa shouted the middle gentleman to Gregors fatherpointing without wasting any more words with his forefinger atGregor as he slowly moved forward  The violin went silent themiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friendsshaking his head and then looked back at Gregor  His father seemedto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen beforedriving Gregor out even though they were not at all upset andseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playinghad been  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out andattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time astrying to block their view of Gregor with his body  Now they didbecome a little annoyed and it was not clear whether it was hisfathers behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation thatthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room withoutknowing it  They asked Gregors father for explanations raisedtheir arms like he had tugged excitedly at their beards and movedback towards their room only very slowly  Meanwhile Gregors sisterhad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing wassuddenly interrupted  She had let her hands drop and let violin andbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as ifstill playing but then she suddenly pulled herself together laythe instrument on her mothers lap who still sat laboriouslystruggling for breath where she was and ran into the next roomwhich under pressure from her father the three gentlemen were morequickly moving toward  Under his sisters experienced hand thepillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order andshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out againbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room  Gregors fatherseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all therespect he owed to his tenants  He urged them and pressed themuntil when he was already at the door of the room the middle ofthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot andthereby brought Gregors father to a halt  I declare here andnow he said raising his hand and glancing at Gregors mother andsister to gain their attention too that with regard to therepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor  I giveimmediate notice on my room  For the days that I have been livinghere I will of course pay nothing at all on the contrary I willconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damagesfrom you and believe me it would be very easy to set out thegrounds for such an action  He was silent and looked straightahead as if waiting for something  And indeed his two friendsjoined in with the words And we also give immediate notice  Withthat he took hold of the door handle and slammed the doorGregors father staggered back to his seat feeling his way with hishands and fell into it it looked as if he was stretching himselfout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his headkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at allThroughout all this Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemenhad first seen him  His disappointment at the failure of his planand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger made it impossiblefor him to move  He was sure that everyone would turn on him anymoment and he waited  He was not even startled out of this statewhen the violin on his mothers lap fell from her trembling fingersand landed loudly on the floorFather Mother said his sister hitting the table with her handas introduction we cant carry on like this  Maybe you cant seeit but I can  I dont want to call this monster my brother all Ican say is we have to try and get rid of it  Weve done all thatshumanly possible to look after it and be patient I dont thinkanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrongShes absolutely right said Gregors father to himself  Hismother who still had not had time to catch her breath began tocough dully her hand held out in front of her and a derangedexpression in her eyesGregors sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on herforehead  Her words seemed to give Gregors father some moredefinite ideas  He sat upright played with his uniform cap betweenthe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal andoccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobileWe have to try and get rid of it said Gregors sister nowspeaking only to her father as her mother was too occupied withcoughing to listen itll be the death of both of you I can see itcoming  We cant all work as hard as we have to and then come hometo be tortured like this we cant endure it  I cant endure it anymore  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed downthe face of her mother and she wiped them away with mechanical handmovementsMy child said her father with sympathy and obvious understandingwhat are we to doHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessnessand tears that had taken hold of her displacing her earliercertaintyIf he could just understand us said his father almost as aquestion his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears asa sign that of that there was no questionIf he could just understand us repeated Gregors father closinghis eyes in acceptance of his sisters certainty that that was quiteimpossible then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangementwith him  But as it is Its got to go shouted his sister thats the only way FatherYouve got to get rid of the idea that thats Gregor  Weve onlyharmed ourselves by believing it for so long  How can that beGregor If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that its notpossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and hewould have gone of his own free will  We wouldnt have a brotherany more then but we could carry on with our lives and rememberhim with respect  As it is this animal is persecuting us itsdriven out our tenants it obviously wants to take over the wholeflat and force us to sleep on the streets  Father look justlook she suddenly screamed hes starting again   In her alarmwhich was totally beyond Gregors comprehension his sister evenabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of herchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stayanywhere near Gregor  She rushed over to behind her father who hadbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising hishands in front of Gregors sister as if to protect herBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone least of allhis sister  All he had done was begin to turn round so that hecould go back into his room although that was in itself quitestartling as his painwracked condition meant that turning roundrequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to helphimself do it repeatedly raising it and striking it against thefloor  He stopped and looked round  They seemed to have realisedhis good intention and had only been alarmed briefly  Now they alllooked at him in unhappy silence  His mother lay in her chair withher legs stretched out and pressed against each other her eyesnearly closed with exhaustion his sister sat next to his fatherwith her arms around his neckMaybe now theyll let me turn round thought Gregor and went backto work  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and hadsometimes to stop and take a rest  Noone was making him rush anymore everything was left up to him  As soon as he had finallyfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead  He wasamazed at the great distance that separated him from his room andcould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weakstate a little while before and almost without noticing it  Heconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed thatthere was not a word not any cry from his family to distract himHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway  He didnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiffbut it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him hadchanged only his sister had stood up  With his last glance he sawthat his mother had now fallen completely asleepHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shutbolted and locked  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled himthat his little legs collapsed under him  It was his sister who hadbeen in so much of a rush  She had been standing there waiting andsprung forward lightly Gregor had not heard her coming at all andas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents AtlastWhat now then Gregor asked himself as he looked round in thedarkness  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer moveat all  This was no surprise to him it seemed rather that beingable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until thenwas unnatural  He also felt relatively comfortable  It is truethat his entire body was aching but the pain seemed to be slowlygetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogetherHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or theinflamed area around it which was entirely covered in white dustHe thought back of his family with emotion and love  If it waspossible he felt that he must go away even more strongly than hissister  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful ruminationuntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning  Hewatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside thewindow too  Then without his willing it his head sank downcompletely and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrilsWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning  theyd often askedher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in herhurry she still did so that everyone in the flat knew when shedarrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace  shemade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothingspecial  She thought he was laying there so still on purposeplaying the martyr she attributed all possible understanding tohim  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand so shetried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway  When she had nosuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and pokedat him a little and only when she found she could shove him acrossthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attentionShe soon realised what had really happened opened her eyes widewhistled to herself but did not waste time to yank open the bedroomdoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms Come andave a look at this its dead just lying there stone deadMr and  Mrs Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and hadto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner beforethey could grasp what she was saying  But then each from his ownside they hurried out of bed  Mr Samsa threw the blanket over hisshoulders  Mrs Samsa just came out in her nightdress and that ishow they went into Gregors room  On the way they opened the doorto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the threegentlemen had moved in she was fully dressed as if she had neverbeen asleep and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm thisDead asked  Mrs Samsa looking at the charwoman enquiringlyeven though she could have checked for herself and could have knownit even without checking  Thats what I said  replied thecleaner and to prove it she gave Gregors body another shove withthe broom sending it sideways across the floor  Mrs Samsa made amovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom but did notcomplete it  Now then said  Mr Samsa lets give thanks to Godfor that He crossed himself and the three women followed hisexample  Grete who had not taken her eyes from the corpse saidJust look how thin he was  He didnt eat anything for so longThe food came out again just the same as when it went in Gregorsbody was indeed completely dried up and flat they had not seen ituntil then but now he was not lifted up on his little legs nor didhe do anything to make them look awayGrete come with us in here for a little while said  Mrs Samsawith a pained smile and Grete followed her parents into the bedroombut not without looking back at the body  The cleaner shut the doorand opened the window wide  Although it was still early in themorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it  Itwas already the end of March after allThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round inamazement for their breakfasts  they had been forgotten aboutWhere is our breakfast the middle gentleman asked the cleanerirritably  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick andsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregorsroom  They did so and stood around Gregors corpse with theirhands in the pockets of their wellworn coats It was now quitelight in the roomThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr Samsa appeared in hisuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other  Allof them had been crying a little Grete now and then pressed herface against her fathers armLeave my home  Now said  Mr Samsa indicating the door andwithout letting the women from him  What do you mean asked themiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted and he smiledsweetly  The other two held their hands behind their backs andcontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loudquarrel which could only end in their favour  I mean just what Isaid answered  Mr Samsa and with his two companions went in astraight line towards the man  At first he stood there stilllooking at the ground as if the contents of his head wererearranging themselves into new positions  Alright well gothen he said and looked up at  Mr Samsa as if he had beensuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again fromMr Samsa for his decision  Mr Samsa merely opened his eyes wideand briefly nodded to him several times  At that and withoutdelay the man actually did take long strides into the fronthallway his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some timebefore and had been listening to what was being said  Now theyjumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear thatMr Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break theconnection with their leader  Once there all three took their hatsfrom the stand took their sticks from the holder bowed without aword and left the premises  Mr Samsa and the two women followedthem out onto the landing but they had had no reason to mistrustthe mens intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw howthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the manysteps  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared andwould reappear a few moments later the further down they went themore that the Samsa family lost interest in them when a butchersboy proud of posture with his tray on his head passed them on hisway up and came nearer than they were  Mr Samsa and the women cameaway from the landing and went as if relieved back into the flatThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxationand to go for a walk not only had they earned a break from work butthey were in serious need of it  So they sat at the table and wrotethree letters of excusal  Mr Samsa to his employers  Mrs Samsato her contractor and Grete to her principal  The cleaner came inwhile they were writing to tell them she was going shed finishedher work for that morning  The three of them at first just noddedwithout looking up from what they were writing and it was only whenthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked upin irritation  Well asked  Mr Samsa  The charwoman stood inthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendousgood news to report but would only do it if she was clearly askedto  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat whichhad been a source of irritation to  Mr Samsa all the time she hadbeen working for them swayed gently in all directions  What is ityou want then asked  Mrs Samsa whom the cleaner had the mostrespect for  Yes she answered and broke into a friendly laughthat made her unable to speak straight away well then that thingin there you neednt worry about how youre going to get rid of it Thats all been sorted out   Mrs Samsa and Grete bent down overtheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they werewriting  Mr Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describingeverything in detail but with outstretched hand he made it quiteclear that she was not to  So as she was prevented from tellingthem all about it she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was inand clearly peeved called out Cheerio then everyone turnedround sharply and left slamming the door terribly as she wentTonight she gets sacked said  Mr Samsa but he received no replyfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to havedestroyed the peace they had only just gained  They got up and wentover to the window where they remained with their arms around eachother  Mr Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and satthere watching for a while  Then he called out Come here thenLets forget about all that old stuff shall we  Come and give me abit of attention The two women immediately did as he saidhurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and thenthey quickly finished their lettersAfter that the three of them left the flat together which wassomething they had not done for months and took the tram out to theopen country outside the town  They had the tram filled with warmsunshine all to themselves  Leant back comfortably on their seatsthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examinationthey were not at all bad  until then they had never asked eachother about their work but all three had jobs which were very goodand held particularly good promise for the future  The greatestimprovement for the time being of course would be achieved quiteeasily by moving house what they needed now was a flat that wassmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen byGregor one that was in a better location and most of all morepractical  All the time Grete was becoming livelier  With all theworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale butwhile they were talking  Mr and  Mrs Samsa were struck almostsimultaneously with the thought of how their daughter wasblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady  They becamequieter  Just from each others glance and almost without knowingit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man forher  And as if in confirmation of their new dreams and goodintentions as soon as they reached their destination Grete was thefirst to get up and stretch out her young body\n"
